# Pipboy

War. War never changes. The end of the world occurred pretty much as we had predicted. Too many humans, not enough space or resources to go around. The details are trivial and pointless, the reasons, as always, purely human ones.

On a somewhat lighter note, this pipboy allows you to save your config files, wherever they might be.
